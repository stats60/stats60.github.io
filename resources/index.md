### Solving problems

If you encounter an error when learning to program in R, it's almost certain that someone else has encountered the same problem in the past.  Usually, pasting the text of the error message into a Google search is sufficient to help find the answer.

### Sources for interesting datasets

The TAs have identified many interesting and easier to manipulate datasets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qyTwagdPV6h8_Y3oioxFraDO9h295MhDTz39GVJ5_Xc/edit?usp=sharing). In addition, we can recommend:
