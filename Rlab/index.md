title: Psych 10: R Labs

## R Labs 

Wednesday sessions are dedicated to R Labs. R Labs are an important component of the course, and a vital one for the project. The goal is to familiarize students with R's tools for data analysis. Lectures will be interactive with a focus on learning by example, and assignments will be application-driven. No prior programming experience is needed. Topics covered include basic data structures, File I/O, data transformation and visualization, simple statistical tests, etc, and some useful packages in R.

We will cover the following topics. This page will be updated throughout the quarter to reflect any updates.
