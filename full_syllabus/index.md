## Overview of the course

**Rationale**: It is impossible to understand the modern world without an understanding of statistics.  From public opinion polls to clinical trials in medicine to online systems that recommend purchases to us, statistics play a role in nearly every aspect of our lives. The goal of this course is to provide an understanding of the essential concepts and “big ideas” of statistics --- describing data and making decisions and predictions based on data -- as well as the skills to employ these concepts on real data to solve authentic problems. At the end of the course, students will possess:
- *Statistical literacy*: The ability to dissect and understand statistical claims in scientific research and popular media
- *Statistical ability*: The skills necessary to apply statistical analysis methods to real data
- *Statistical curiosity*: The interest in further developing their statistical skills and knowledge, and the confidence in their ability to do so

**Instructional philosophy**.  My instructional philosophy is based on the overwhelming scientific evidence that the standard instructional model  (a lecturer talking at students for a long period) is an ineffective way to instill lasting skills and knowledge.  Instead, I will aim for the course to be:
- *Active*: The classroom experience should be more like a conversation than a one-directional transmission of information.
- *Evidence-based*: Frequent assessments will provide the instructors with ongoing information about student learning, so that we can base the progression of the course on data rather than subjective impressions.
- *Authentic*: We will engage with real data in all its messiness using real statistical tools, with the goal of learning how to solve real problems and how to avoid common missteps and pitfalls.

Statistics is a broad field, and the goal of this course is not “coverage” of the entire field or simple familiarity with the concepts. Instead, we will work towards a deep understanding and ability to apply a set of core concepts, and we will actively adjust the course based on the results from our daily assessments.  

**Prerequisites**: Students should have a solid understanding of high school mathematics (specifically algebra).  The course will also assume facility with using the internet and a personal computer.

**Course Requirements**:  You will need a laptop computer for use in every class.  If you do not have access to a laptop please contact the instructor ASAP and we will help you obtain access to one.  

**Classrooom response**: We will use [PollEverywhere](http://polleverywhere.com) for responding to questions during class.  You will need a computer or device that enables you to respond during every class session.  Instructions will be provided on how to set up your PollEverywhere account.

**Website**: The primary web site for the class is http://psych10.github.io.  We will use Canvas for in-class online quizzes, to submit assignments, and to post grades.

**Discussion**.  We will be using Piazza to allow you to get help efficiently from both your classmates and the instructors. Please post your questions about the course material and course logistics to Piazza so that everyone can benefit from the answer. We also highly encourage you to answer your classmates’ questions whenever possible – you will get extra practice with the material and receive feedback from the teaching team about your answers. As an added incentive, students who provide frequent, high-quality answers may receive extra credit on their final course grades. Additional guidelines about posting on Piazza are available on the [Piazza page](https://piazza.com/class/j5sog4z8i73q7).

**Materials**: The primary textbook is An Adventure in Statistics: The Reality Enigma by Andy Field.   The book is available for purchase at the Stanford Bookstore and has a companion web site with lots of additional resources [here] (https://edge.sagepub.com/field-an-adventure-in-stats).  It is also available as an e-book from the Amazon Kindle Store if you prefer that format.  A copy of the book is on reserve at Li & Ma Science Library.

We will supplement this textbook with other [free online resources](../resources/).

You will need to install the free software package RStudio on your computer for use in class. See [here](../rstudio/) for instructions.

Lecture slides will be available on the Canvas site. The slides are not intended to replace attendance, since much of the class activity will go beyond the slides.

The VPTL office offers tutoring for this class by appointment, which can be scheduled [here](https://vptl.stanford.edu/students/tutoring-foreign-language-practice).

Stanford University and its instructors are committed to ensuring that all courses are financially accessible to all students. If you are an undergraduate who needs assistance with the cost of course textbooks, supplies, materials and/or fees, you are welcome to approach me directly. If would prefer not to approach me directly, please note that you can ask the Diversity & First-Gen Office for assistance by completing their [questionnaire on course textbooks & supplies](http://tinyurl.com/jpqbarn) or by contacting Joseph Brown, the Associate Director of the Diversity and First-Gen Office (jlbrown@stanford.edu; Old Union Room 207). Dr. Brown is available to connect you with resources and support while ensuring your privacy.

## Assessment and grading

Grades will be determined as follows:

- Pre-class assignments (20% credit for completion)
- In-class assessments (40%: half of the assessments will give credit for completion, while half will be graded for content)
- Written assignments/problem sets (25%)
- Final project writeup (10%)
- Section attendance and participation (5%)

Each of the two lowest pre-class assignment grades, graded in-class assessments, and credit/no-credit assessments will be dropped to compute the final grade.

There is no midterm or final examination for this class: the scheduled final exam time will be used for a party with presentations of group projects.  

Unless otherwise stated, you can use any published resource you wish to complete the assessments (textbook, Internet, etc).  However, you should not discuss the answers with your fellow students in person or electronically unless instructed to do so by the instructors; sharing answers (including computer code) will be viewed as a violation of the Honor Code.

**Pre-class assignments**:  On most days with reading assignments you will be responsible for completing a short questionnaire in order to gauge understanding of the content and provide feedback for the instructional team regarding concepts that need extra discussion.  You will be given credit for simply completing the assignment in a comprehensible manner.  

**In-class assessments**:  During many class sessions you will complete an online activity to assess your learning of the important concepts or skills for that day.  Half of these will be graded for content, while the others will be credit/no-credit (i.e. you get the credit simply for completing the assessment during class in a comprehensible manner).  

**Written assignments**: Most weeks you will be given one written assignment or problem set to complete.  These will be due at 7 PM on Tuesdays, submitted via Canvas.

**Sections**: Section attendance is mandatory. If you are unable to attend your assigned section on a given week, you may attend a different section with permission from both section leaders. Requests to attend an alternate section should be made at least 24 hours in advance.

**Final project**: Each student will participate in a group project with 3-4 other students.
The project must test a set of specific hypotheses using a real world dataset.   The group must decide what hypotheses to test, and discuss the idea with their TA in section to get approval for the idea.  They must then do a literature review to find out what has been done on the question before, perform the analyses, and write a report on the results as well as provide the R code used to perform the entire analysis.  These reports will be peer-reviewed.  All groups will be given the opportunity to make a short presentation of their results at the finals week party.

A list of public data resources is provided on the [Resources page](../resources/)

**Grade disputes**:  Students must wait 24 hours after receiving a grade before they can dispute it, after which disputes must be received within 7 days of receipt of the grade. Grade disputes must be submitted to the instructor by email.

## General course policies
**Feedback**: We welcome student feedback regarding the course at any point.  Please feel free to email us directly, or leave anonymous feedback for the instructional team by placing an anonymous note in Dr. Poldrack’s mailbox at Jordan Hall.  

**Gender expression/identity:**
This course affirms people of all gender expressions and gender identities. If you prefer to be called a different name than what is indicated on the class roster, please let me know. Feel free to correct me on your preferred gender pronoun. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

**Code of conduct:**
You are expected to treat the instructional team and your fellow students with courtesy and respect.  
This class should be a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. Harassment of any form will not be tolerated.
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible to one of the instructors. 

**Students with Documented Disabilities:**
Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE).  Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is being made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations.  The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, URL: http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/oae).
