title: Psych 10: Syllabus

## Syllabus

We will cover the following topics. The last few lectures of the class will discuss some active areas such as reproducibility in the scienes, with some topics still pending to change. This page will be updated throughout the quarter to reflect any updates, including reading material drawn from the [*Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century textbook*](https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/).


Wednesday sessions are dedicated to R Labs. R Labs are an important component of the course, and a vital one for the project. The goal is to familiarize students with R's tools for data analysis. Lectures will be interactive with a focus on learning by example, and assignments will be application-driven. No prior programming experience is needed. Topics covered include basic data structures, File I/O, data transformation and visualization, simple statistical tests, etc, and some useful packages in R. The reading material will be drawn from the [R Companion](https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-R-site/).
